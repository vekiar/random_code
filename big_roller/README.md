## Problem
### Part 1
Casino-style game.  
1-player game.  
Goal: maximise earnings.  
20-sided die.  
1-value face facing up.  
100 turns.  
Each turn is an option: 1/ roll the die; xor 2/ take $<value_of_die>.  
Question: 1/ how would you play the game; 2/ what is max($ earnings)?  

### Part 2
Take the money; take the die off the table.  
Have to spend 1 turn rolling the die before you can take money again.  
Roll: 1 turn; Take: 1 turn. Roll, take, roll, roll, take = 5 turns.  

### Part 3
Back to Part 1 mechanics.  
Casino gets to play.  
Take money, casino decides to re-roll or not (you do not lose your turn), to minimise potential earnings.
